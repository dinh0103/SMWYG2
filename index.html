        <h2>What Is PEAK?</h2>
        <p>
          PEAK is a 3D game on Steam that costs $7.99. The island map generation changes daily so there's always a new challenge each day.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are lost on a mysterious island with friends and you have to scale all the way to the end to escape.
          However as you travel further, there will be obstacles trying to kill you before you reach the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some players refer to games like Peak as “friendslop,” a term used for multiplayer-focused games designed around playing with friends to create funny moments and shareable clips. 
          These games often gain popularity for a few months before fading out, but they remain a fun and memorable experience.

        <h2>Core Mechanics</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>You have limited stamina that can regenerate and it decreases as you get hungry or get poisoned.</li>
            <li>Falling from any tall height will take out a chunk of stamina you can't recover unless you find bandages.</li>
            <li>Your inventory has 3 slots and one for your backpack which can hold 4 more items. They all have weight that can take up your stamina bar.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Multiplayer & Teamwork</h2>
        <p>
          Your friends can lend you a hand if they are already at the top of the ledge but you can also ration out items between each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having friends change the experience some may work with or against you depending on how serious they want to play. Overall it makes a great team-building game to have a laugh with friends!
